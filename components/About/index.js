You must be registered for Reflections|Projections to compete in MechMania. You can find more info at mechmania.io.'},

Competitors need to bring their own laptops. Due to Covid restrictions, please do not bring food into Siebel 1404 if you plan to attend in person.'},

      {question:'Whoâ€™s eligible?',answer:"Anyone can play! We strongly recommend playing with friends, because the more the merrier. If you haven't met any friends who are interested in playing, sign up anyway! We'll have a discord server up this year and a #looking-for-group channel."},
      {question:'What will you need to have?',answer:"Access to a functional human brain, an internet connection, a computer with a current web browser, and an open mind. We're also adding discord support this year, so a microphone + speakers will enhance the experience."},
      {question:'What do you need to know?',answer:"Everything! No, just kidding. Wikipedia's classical cipher's page might be useful. A number of letters in the alphabet, number of cards in a deck, all the US state abbreviations, and silly other things that you've probably run across in your daily life. Some awareness of the recent memes and popular culture will probably be helpful. Knowledge of UIUC's campus layout will be really helpful."},
      {question:'What do you not need to know?',answer:'How to write code. It might be useful to be able to write a script to print out all the ways you can rearrange a set of letters, or apply different ciphers to them, but in general, you should be able to do everything by hand or ask Google and find a tool online to do it for you.'},
